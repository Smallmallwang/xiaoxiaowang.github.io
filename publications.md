## Working Paper

- [Information Asymmetry, Fiscal Competition and Optimal Interregional Transfer](https://xiaoxiaowang.com/mypaper/thesis/Wang_etal_Information_Asymmetry.pdf)<br>**Xiaoxiao Wang**†, Xufeng Zhao†~, Guojun Lu†<br>

This paper explores the optimal intergovernmental transfer policy when there exists information asymmetry between one central government and multiple local governments. The central government allocates transfers based on observable local output, which is influenced by local private information, output shocks, and endogenous fiscal expenditures. Local governments also leverage their private information to engage in interregional fiscal competition. Theoretically, the optimal transfer policy functions simultaneously as interregional insurance, information rent, and Pigouvian taxation correcting fiscal competition. The information rent is further decomposed into behavioral elasticities and multipliers capturing how the deviation from the IC constraint influences social welfare. Using 2019 Chinese county-level fiscal data, we find that the optimal transfer payment exhibits an inverted U-shape with per capita GDP, emphasizing its roles in providing inter-regional insurance and incentivizing local expenditure efforts. Specifically, we quantify the effects of information asymmetry, local governors' competitive motivations, and economic fluctuations on the optimal transfer policy.

- [Optimal Mixed Taxation with Misperceptions of Prices](https://xiaoxiaowang.com/mypaper/thesis/Cui_mixed_taxation_misperception.pdf)<br>Xiaoyong Cui, **Xiaoxiao Wang**~, Chengyuan<br>

This paper investigates how price misperceptions,  which are pervasive and mainly ascribed to a complex system of mixed tax schedules, affect the design of optimal tax rules. Our theoretical results show that in the presence of price misperceptions indirect taxation exerts both a corrective role and a redistributive role even with the preference structure of Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976). This makes the linear commodity taxation no longer superfluous. In particular, the optimal income tax schedule can be more progressive if perceived marginal income tax rates are influenced by commodity prices. Moreover,  taking income tax credit for electric vehicles as an example we simulate the optimal subsidy rate and income tax schedule when price misperceptions are considered in the design of optimal mixed taxation. Compared with conventional optimal taxation, optimal taxation in our model results in a rise in welfare by  8.79% to  36.34%  under plausible values of labor supply elasticity.
